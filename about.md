Hi! I'm Maya, I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in digital art and design. I currently work at a [digital design agency](https://wearecmyk.com/agents/maya-arguelles/) doing web development, and hope to continue pursuing web development after graduation.  

Pretty handy with HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. Not quite handy with, but maybe I'd give a finger to Java, Python, and C.

## Stuff I've made

Here are some things I'm proud of:

### You Are Alone

My final project for Drawing on the Web here at NYU.
