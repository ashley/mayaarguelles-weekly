I would say it's no more difficult to get involved with a humanitarian open-source project than it is to get involved in any other open-source project _technically_, although HFOSS projects might skew more beginner friendly. With more humanitarian missions, one would think that the communities would be more welcoming and friendly to newer contributors. Moreover, a lot of HFOSS projects are data-oriented, which means that perhaps not as much knowledge of programming intricacies is needed to get involved in the project.

> Do you think involvement in such projects bring more or less prestige to the contributor (compared to other projects)?

Again I'd say no more or no less than non-humanitarian open-source projects. Obviously it depends on the project, but there are absolutely 'prestigious' HFOSS projects. Even though HFOSS are meant to be more accessible for an end user, this by no means diminishes the amount of work that needs to go into such projects. (One might even argue it's harder to create accessible end products from inaccessible means).

> Would you want to be involved in a project like that?

If I found a project that had a mission that really spoke to me, absolutely!
