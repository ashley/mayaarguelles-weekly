title: Wikipedia and Project Progress

> With regards to Gatsby.js: What have you done, what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week?

We used last week to set up communication channels and start to get a feel for the project. To do so, we've joined the community Discord server, kept track of relevant / accomplishable issues in a team issue tracker of our own, and begun to attempt to contribute to the project. The first issue we picked out to work on was fixing a bug that initiated a new git repository whenever `gatsby new gatsby-site` regardless of whether the current directory was already in an existing git repository -- creating erratic behavior with git submodules. I created a general framework for the solution that I didn't think would work cross-platform, so I opened it up to the team and proposed a possible cross-platform solution in the fork issue tracker.

> From your own point of view, what kind of people contribute to Wikipedia?

While a wide variety of people can and do contribute to Wikipedia, I'd say the general uniting factor is that the people who contribute to Wikipedia are those with the means, interest, and time to contribute to Wikipedia, which perhaps limits the scope of contributors (unintentionally) to those with the luxury of leisure time.

> Do you think you might one day become a regular contributor?

I've thought about trying to get involved with Wikipedia before but I don't think I'd ever become a truly regular contributor, mostly because I'm flaky and am unable to commit to projects for long periods of time.

> How will you select the articles to contribute as part of the required contributions for this class?

I'll probably choose articles based on a combination of the following questions:
1. Am I interested in the topic at hand?
2. Can I contribute anything meaningful?
3. Do I already know something more about the topic, or will it require research?

> Watch and comment of the TED talk that Jimmy Wales gave on the Birth of Wikipedia in 2005. Did you find any ideas and topics that were out of date?

It seemed that most of what Jimmy Wales (as far as I know) rings true today -- the only thing that I could see out of place in today's Wikipedia might be the insistence that pages don't really get locked, as we saw a number of pages that were locked either due to controversy or reaching a "complete"
status when we looked at Wikipedia pages in class. Also -- his idea that the world would move to freely licensed textbooks sounds fantastic but is definitely not the case.
