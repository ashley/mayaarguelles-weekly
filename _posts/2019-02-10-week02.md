This week, my group and I created an extension that "cracks" your screen. I mostly contributed front end work, in terms of styling and structuring the extension modal and styling the injected overlay to create the "cracked" screen effect. I also added the license while we were initializing our project, and helped contribute to documentation.

We ran into some issues with debugging our project at first because we couldn't locate the Mozilla extension debugger, and there are no out-of-the-box tools available in the default developer tabs to view a console or web inspector specific to your extension. We have ended up with a working extension though.

This week I learned about pull requests for the first time. While I use git reguarly at my office for collaborating on projects, we are pretty haphazard with our workflow  as sometimes our work is not quite easily divided into mutually exclusive features, so we merge pretty often and incorporate each others work on the fly, which makes it annoying to go through the formal process of submitting a pull request, evaluating it and approving it every time you just need to grab a snippet of CSS that you want to reuse that someone else just made.
