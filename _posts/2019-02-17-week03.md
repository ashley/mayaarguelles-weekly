Creating our open-source browser extension went fairly well, especially since we set aside time to meet in person and work on the extension together. Initially, there was a little bit of confusion in setting up files because we were working on files simultaneously or waiting on initial files from other group members, but after the initial setup was complete and we divided up the work, the workflow was pretty smooth.

Since we met in person and managed to get most of our work done together, our formal workflow was probably not as strict in terms of documented communication, pull requests and the like, but essentially the same practices were happening in person.
