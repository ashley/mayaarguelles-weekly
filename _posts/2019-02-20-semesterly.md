Semester.ly is an open-source course scheduler that helps students coordinate their semester's class schedules as well as see what classes their friends are planning on taking while choosing prospective classes. It works in tandem with official course scheduling services to allow students a more user-friendly method to schedule their classes.

I'm interested in Semester.ly primarily because Albert is so awful, so this would *personally* be really useful to implement for NYU, but also because Semester.ly is developed by students for students. It seems like it would be a great fit for this class because not only is it organized by students like ourselves, but they are looking to expand the number of schools supported by the service, which would involve creating a generally simple web crawler to parse courses from Albert to the Semester.ly database -- which seems prime for a first time contribution.
